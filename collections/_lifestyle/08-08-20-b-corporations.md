What is the long-term objective of the company you work for, or maybe your own company? Have you ever thought about it? And, does it matter to you what the decisions and consequences are for your company? Everyone finds it important to have a company that gives fulfillment. An organization that makes a change for the good.

To find out if a company is actually doing what they are saying is hard when they need to keep a good image to their stakeholders and customers. These days it is status for a company to care about social innovation and sustainable solutions and hence advertise themselves to improve their status.

It is important for companies to be transparent about their activities and how they really feel about global ideas. Especially when they have more money, data and can in some cases be more powerful than a government like the *["frightful five"](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/26/560136311/how-5-tech-giants-have-become-more-like-governments-than-companies?t=1596886430368)*.

It is undoubtedly that corporations of these sizes have a big influence on the activities within our ecosystem like the economy, our psychology, and stock market fluctuations. When these companies are not transparent enough, they will have the power to make this change without the global community knowing about it. Less transparency means less trustable I would say.

Many people nowadays take a step backward from popular social media like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. The biggest reason for people to leave Facebook is to avoid wasting time and procrastination. Additionally, one of the biggest reasons is due to a lack of trust and concerns about their privacy, which is in turn a lack of transparency. According to [this article](https://www.trustradius.com/buyer-blog/should-you-trust-social-media-trustradius-poll), LinkedIn appears to be the most trustable our of the big social media platforms that exist.

Surely, transparency is an important aspect of the culture and mindset within an organization. Transparency allows companies to show how they handle social affairs like employer satisfaction, community improvement next to their day-to-day activities, sustainable solutions, global awareness, and financial equality for their employee groups. 

Luckily there exist the B Lab. An organization that provides **B Certifications** to **B**eneficial businesses that achieved the minimum requirements for the certification. This allows businesses to show that they have a standard in terms of transparency and awareness.

> Certifying as a B Corporation goes beyond product- or service-level certification. B Corp Certification is the only certification that measures a companyâ€™s entire social and environmental performance.

The B Corp movement started in the year 2006 by three friends who dedicated their time and energy to make it easier for companies with a mission to protect and improve their positive impact. - [https://bcorporation.net/faqs](https://bcorporation.net/faqs)

For many, and especially for me it is important to work or do business with organizations that want to have these standards. They show that they are actively fighting for a genuine image that shows integrity in different social areas.

The organization behind the B certification has the mission to slowly convert our current economy in a [more transparent, people-friendly, sustainable world that is going to work on the long term!](https://bcorporation.net/b-economy) 

If you feel like supporting the idea of a B Economy, follow the companies with the certification in your area or even globally like [Patagonia](https://bcorporation.net/directory/patagonia-inc), and fight for a high "B Impact Score" for your organization.
