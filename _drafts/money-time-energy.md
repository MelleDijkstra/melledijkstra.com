What is the most important thing in life? Is it the money, or the idea that you can buy anything with that money? Or is it spending holidays with your family? Maybe the most important thing is to have the time to do whatever you want yourself. What about traveling to all those places you wanted to go.

Its all of these things. All of these things make us happy in some way. And that is what we all want in the end right? Just to be happy.

I am still young, but when I was even younger I started to think about my first travel trip that I wanted to realize. The best time to do it was during summer vacation, because, that is when I had the most time. The accommodation and way of transportation had to be cheap, because as a student you don't have a big budget.

The triangle of **money**, **time**, and **energy** actually governs among all of us in life. The *rich*, the *poor*, the *intelligent*, the *dumb*, everyone is included and every individual has his own triangle.

The impact of this triangle in our life is large on a long-term scale and so important that I needed to write about it. Because I want people to understand how it works and more importantly on how to make your triangle work more effectively for you.

Every single person on earth probably asked themselves the question of "How do I get rich?" at one point in their life.
Did you find the answer? If yes, good for you, you are probably richer now. However I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the idea of "rich". After a while I got to the conclusion does not mean to "have a lot of money". Rich for me is to make the triangle work in the most effective way for you.

> "There are two ways to become rich, work hard or take enough with less"

And I think the majority of people like the second answer more than the first. So why are we working more than we have to? Don't get me wrong, working is important in life. But when I read in the news that there are more adults of 25 years old that have a burnout then ever before [source], I really start to question if we are actually "improving" our status of wealth.

In this example these 25 year old adults probably have a lack in energy and time, but probably (and hopefully) are earning a lot of money. The question is what are they earning this money for? For this amazing car, clothes, phone? Are they really going to enjoy it when they don't have any time to even enjoy it?

If I would was them, I would have **bought time!** You are thinking, buying time? What do I mean with buying time.

Once you worked hard and you have spend a lot of work into receiving a bunch of money, you should also make sure that you buy time to regenerate that energy that you "spend". Isn't it funny that we use the same verb in English for spending "money" and "energy". It indicates that it is closely related.

How can you buy time?
